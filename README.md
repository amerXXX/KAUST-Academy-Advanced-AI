# KAUST-Academy-Advanced-AI-
KAUST Academy Advanced AI is a one-week immersive program blending lectures with hands-on PyTorch labs and exams. It covers computer-vision fundamentals, CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, MobileNet), object detection (YOLO), semantic &amp; instance segmentation, data augmentation, transfer learning, and ensemble methods. Certificate awarded.
# Labs

Each notebook in this folder provides a hands-on PyTorch exercise aligned with the Advanced AI Program:

- **Lab 1.1: PyTorch Basics**  
  Introduction to tensors, operations, autograd, and building simple feed-forward networks.

- **Lab 1.2: Image Classification on CIFAR-10**  
  Implement and train a convolutional neural network for multi-class image classification.

- **Lab 1.3: Image Generation with Autoencoders (MNIST)**  
  Build and train a basic autoencoder to reconstruct and generate handwritten-digit images.

- **Lab 2.1: Dataset Augmentations Basics**  
  Explore common image augmentation techniques (flips, crops, color jitter) and their impact on model performance.

- **Lab 2.2: Fine-tuning on Cats vs. Dogs**  
  Load a pre-trained CNN, adapt it to a binary classification task, and compare frozen vs. end-to-end training.

- **Lab 2.4: Image Retrieval with EfficientNetV2**  
  Extract deep features using EfficientNetV2 and implement a simple image-search/retrieval pipeline.

- **Lab 3.1.1: Custom UNet for Segmentation**  
  Design and train a U-Net architecture from scratch for semantic segmentation tasks.

- **Lab 3.1.2: Segmentation with SMP UNet**  
  Use the `segmentation_models_pytorch` libraryâ€™s UNet implementation for faster prototyping.

- **Lab 3.2.1: Object Detection with Faster R-CNN**  
  Fine-tune a Faster R-CNN model on a custom dataset and evaluate detection performance.

- **Lab 3.2.2: YOLO Object Detection**  
  Train and run inference with a YOLO model, covering bounding-box predictions and non-maximum suppression.
